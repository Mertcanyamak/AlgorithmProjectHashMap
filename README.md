# Algorithms Project

>Your program will accept 2 files as input.
>First input file is small (3 lines) where each line consists of 2 or 3 word phrases (i.e. "hay fever") .
>Second file, each line contains 1 sentence per line . 
>Your program will first load all the phrases from the first file into a hash, with each phrase as a separate key.
Then while reading the second file, your program will check if any of the hash keys exist in that sentence (i.e. "spring is a high season for hay fever") and return a message if the phrase exists(i.e.  "hay fever exists in  "spring is a high season for hay fever").
